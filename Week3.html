    <p> For this week of Digital Fabrication I was given the Laser Cutter, a magnificant piece of technology that uses a C02 Based Laser at very high and precise temperatures to cut wood and other material. </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <p>1. Getting Started</p>
    <img src="IMG_6088.jpg" alt="mistakes" style="width:90%"> 
    <p>First things first, we need to generate a design. Since my skills and mathmatical skills via geomatry is not its best we will be using the provided box generator. This website allows us to choose from a large selection of pre-made boxes that can be specifically changed via the given criteria. I chose to use the "Box with living hinge and round corners" and specified the thickness of the cut to be 3.20 seeing as the professor reported that she has a hard time with 3.15.  </p>
    <p>2. Using Adobe Illustrator</p>
    <img src="IMG_6089.jpg" alt="hello world" style="width:90%">
    <p>Now that I have my generated blueprint for my box. We are prompted to save the bluepring as a .svg which will allow us to upload the file to Adobe Illustrator. This is a very important step as it will give us the option to edit and add engravement layers for the laser cutter to read. This in and of itself signifies the Digital Fabrication process of design, conseive, build. </p>
    <img src="IMG_6090.jpg" alt="first error" style="width:90%">
    <p>Within Adobe Illustrator we need to add our engravment. Here we can use the text tool and type out our initials. Since there are two sides to the box I wanted to add my initials on both sides to make it visible no matter where I place the box. While using the Text tool in Illustrator we can choose font and different graphic settings however we cannot change the color. To convert the text we must create an outline of the text in order to turn it into vector based layer for the laser cutter to read as an engraving and not a cut. After this was all done, we can export as an .svg and move on to the next step.</p>
    <p>3. GlowForge WebSoftware</p>
    <img src="IMG_6091.jpg" alt="fixing error 1" style="width:90%">
    <img src="IMG_6092.jpg" alt="fixing error 2" style="width:90%">
    <p>After exorting out finished blueprint we can begin to setup our material and out cut area using the GlowForge WebSoftware. To make sure that the GlowForge is calibrated properly and that it will be safe for cutting when we are ready we must do a few things. First of which is turning on the GlowForge, Second placing our material (plywood) into the cut area, third turning on the airfilter. Once all that is done we can start a new design or project within the GlowForge software and begin the setup process.</p>
    <p>4. Setting up the cutter for cutting</p>
    <img src="IMG_6093.jpg" alt="first push" style="width:90%">
    <p>After we placed our plywood material within the laser cutter and closed the door the laser cutter begins to scan the surface and calibrate for the material that was placed within the cutter. This is important as the laser will not know where to cut if this process is not completed entirely. With this done our screen is updated with a picture of our workspace from inside the laser cutter. We are greated with an outline and introduction to our seperate layers from the .svg file we provided. Before print we must select the material we are using so that the laser knows how strong and how fast it should be cutting. In our case I was using basic C02 Graded Laser Plywood. Next, we must make sure that our lasers are to cut and to engave. Since this was a fairly simple box there were only two real layers with two engravings. We can see on the left side that "TJW" was directed as an engravement and the other layer was directed to cut. We are good to go. We can press the begin cut on the top right hand side of the screen and the file will begin to upload to the cutter. </p>
    <p>5. So it begins</p>
    <img src="IMG_6094.jpg" alt="basic changes" style="width:90%">
    <p>Here we are ready to begin the print. It said that it would take 20 minutes to print which seemed long but was fine in my case. I am ready to press the blue button to begin printed.</p>
    <p>6. The Cutting Process</p>
    <img src="65369135757__128BE04A-BE5A-4EBB-83EA-C4F09C020884.jpg" alt="first night 1" style="width:90%">
    <p>Here is a picture significantly further along in the print as there was not really any noticable changed in the wood besides my engavement.</p>
    <img src="IMG_6096.jpg" alt="first night 2" style="width:90%">
    <img src="IMG_6097.jpg" alt="first night 3" style="width:90%">
    <p>We are now nearing the end of the print as the laser is finishing its final cuts to separate the pieces with the base of the material. </p>
    <p>7. The Pieces</p>
    <img src="IMG_6098.jpg" alt="first night 4" style="width:90%">
    <p>Here are the finished pieces from the cut! Nice and toasty from the extremely hot laser. We are now ready to assemble. First we need to make sure that everything fits together before glueing and making everything perminant. Here we can see that the engravment went perfectly and is legible. We can see that the living sides work perfectly and hold shape along with stretch. It is now time to assemble.</p>
    <p>8. Construction</p>
    <img src="IMG_6099.jpg" alt="adding weeks 1" style="width:90%">
        <p>Now that I have attached all the perminant pieces I need to be glued together I needed a way to keep it in place while it glued. This is the one way that I figured to solve this task. A very interesting contraption although effective. I left them to dry overnight and came back the next day to check on it. </p>
    <img src="IMG_6100.jpg" alt="adding weeks 2" style="width:90%">
        <p>A closer look. </p>
    
    <p>9. The Final Look</p>
    <p>Coming back the next day I was pleasently surprised that the glue had set and that the piece that needed to stay in place was in fact glued in placed with no sign of moving any time soon. From there I was able to test the fideilty of the box and make sure that It was able to open and close. </p>
    <p>That being said however I did notice that where the door meets the other side of the box there is a gap. This was an overlook on my part seeing as there was in fact another piece that I thought was a measurement piece but in fact it was supposed to be clued where the gap is between the door and the other living edge. That being said, I thought that it actually was kind of cool as you could use it for change and or loose money to store. Regardless here is the finished product of my box with two living edges. </p>
