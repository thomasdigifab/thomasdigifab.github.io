    <p>For this weeks project our focus was to create a logo based on a hypothetical company that you are either working for or own. My theme has to do with media and other production oriented work. With that being said I kinda of went all over the place with my design. First, I was thinking to do something related to my name, then I was thinking about a simple clever design that was abstract but also was clean and modern, then I focused on potential animals that could fit the vibe of my work. From their I was able to choose the Grizzly Bear as my animal and was able to construct a simple and effective line art logo of a bear along with using framing techniques to enclose my brand name "Grizzly Media".</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <p>1. Sketches</p>
    <img src="IMG-6141.jpg" alt="Sketches" style="width:90%">
    <p>First step to creating my logo, I needed to sketch. As you can tell I took the work "Sketch" to new extremes. They are rough but they were helpful in helping me get to the eventual final product that you will eventually see later in this documentation of my work. </p>
    <p>2. Moving to Adobe Illustrator</p>
    <img src="embroidery1.JPG" alt="embroidery1" style="width:90%">
    <p>Now that I was in Adobe Illustrator I started playing around with different shapes, tools, and techniques that I either knew or were suggested to me through the Professors videos. This took a long time, I went in so many different directions but finally found my flow and inspiration to try and create what I wanted.</p>
    <img src="embroidery2.JPG" alt="embroidery2" style="width:90%">
    <p>Moving forward I thought that I wanted to go with a Panda with the hopes to come up with a name to the effect of "Bamboo Pictures" or something like that. This did not last and I quickly changed directions.</p>
    <p>3. Second Version</p>
    <img src="embroidery3.JPG" alt="embroidery3" style="width:90%">
    <p>From here we see the beginnings of the final version, a grizzly bear. Here I was experimenting with line segments and using the direct select tool in order to curve and move the line segments that I made.  </p>
    <img src="embroidery4.JPG" alt="embroidery4" style="width:90%">
    <p>Now I had the basic structure of the bear using very simple strokes and shapes. But as you can probably tell. It is quite rough and needs to be corrected. Using different aligning tools and selecting tools I was able to orient and re-align the lines and curves apart of this drawing.</p>
    <p>4. Framing Elements</p>
    <img src="embroidery5.JPG" alt="embroidery5" style="width:90%">
    <p>Here we can see me moving forward with the design. At this point I thought that I was done and that my design was at a point where there wasnt anything else that needed to be added. That being said I moved forward and began adding the framing elements in order to frame my text for my brand name.</p>
    <img src="embroidery6.JPG" alt="embroidery6" style="width:90%">
    <p>Using the scissor tool I cut a section of the top line to make it look like the frame is behind the bear creating depth.</p>
    <p>5. Adding some color</p>
    <img src="embroidery7.JPG" alt="embroidery7" style="width:90%">
    <p>Now that I had my framing element where I wanted it, I needed to add some color. I wanted to keep the actual logo (the bear) to be black and white while having the frame a seperate color. Therefore I changed the black stroke of the frame from black to gold.</p>
    <p>To clarify, I made sure to make all line segments and text strokes to be 8.</p>
    <p>6. Choosing a font</p>
    <img src="embroidery8.JPG" alt="embroidery8" style="width:90%">
    <p>Since I have access to all adobe services I made my way to Adobe Fonts to find a font that fit my design. Here I decided to choose Novecento Sans. </p>
    <img src="embroidery9.JPG" alt="embroidery9" style="width:90%">
    <p>I decided to go with the Novecento Sans condensed Book version. </p>
    <img src="embroidery10.JPG" alt="embroidery10" style="width:90%">
    <p>Here is the text aligned in the frame. </p>
    <img src="embroidery11.JPG" alt="embroidery11" style="width:90%">
    <p> Semi final Product </p>
    
    <p>7. Trying to choose</p>
    <p>After finishing the framing and text, I felt that something was missing so I experimented. This is what I came up with.</p>
    <img src="embroidery12.JPG" alt="embroidery12" style="width:90%">
    <p>8. Starting our bag</p>
    <p>Since for our purposes we are creating a draw string bag with an embroidered desing on it we need to first follow the provided tutorial for our draw string bag. The instructions outline out fabrics which are found below.</p>
    <p>From fabric A, cut two outside pieces: 12 1/2 inches x 12 1/2 inches</p>
    <p>From fabric B, cut two lining pieces: 12 1/2 inches x 12 inches</p>
    <p>From fabric C, cut two drawstring channel pieces: 12 1/2 inches x 2 inches</p>
    <img src="IMG-6436.jpg" alt="adding weeks 1" style="width:90%">
        <p>Here I am cutting out Fabric A  </p>
    <img src="IMG-6437.jpg" alt="adding weeks 2" style="width:90%">
    <img src="IMG-6438.jpg" alt="adding weeks 2" style="width:90%">
        <p>Here I am cutting out Fabric B </p>
    <img src="IMG-6439.jpg" alt="adding weeks 3" style="width:90%">
    <img src="IMG-6440.jpg" alt="adding weeks 2" style="width:90%">
        <p>Here I am cutting Fabric C</p>
    <p>9. Our Materials</p>
    <p>Now that we have all of our materials it is time to assemble. </p>
    <img src="IMG-6441.jpg" alt="linking pages" style="width:90%">
    <p>10. Assembly</p>
    <p>The instructions call to follow these steps "Press in the ends of the channel pieces, forming a 1/4-inch double fold hem. Sew across the folded hem 1/8-inch from the fold. Fold and press each piece in half on the long edge." Make sure to follow these steps through, if you do not it will make life so much harder for you and in my case I did exactly that and it messed up my bag.</p>
    <img src="IMG-6442.jpg" alt="third push 1" style="width:90%">
        <p> Here is the seemed fold of Fabric C </p> 
    <img src="IMG-6445.jpg"alt="third push 2" style="width:90%">
        <p> Again, following the tutorial we need to follow these exact steps "Pin the layers of one side of the bag together. Align the raw edges of the drawstring channel with the top edge of the outside fabric, centering the channel between the two edges. Place the lining fabric on top with right sides facing.

          Sew the layers together with a 1/4-inch seam allowance. Repeat with the remaining pieces. Press the seams open."</p>
    <img src="IMG-6446.jpg"alt="third push 2" style="width:90%">
    <p>Here is me sewing the two edged together using black thread </p>
    <img src="IMG-6448.jpg"alt="third push 2" style="width:90%">
    <p>Here is my final bag. A couple things. Due to lack on knowledge I was not aware that the needle needed to be changed depending on the thickness of the material. With that in mind, that meant that some of my seems did mot stick or went through at all. However, I did my best and continued the process. </p>
    <img src="IMG-6449.jpg"alt="third push 2" style="width:90%">
    <p>Some more pictures</p>
    <img src="IMG-6450.jpg"alt="third push 2" style="width:90%">
    <p>11. Emboidery</p>
    <p>At this point, my what we can now call a sack, is ready to be embroidered. </p>
    <p>First we need to upload our design to premiere where we can upload it to the machine. Go to File - New then use the Lightning then ExpressDesign then ExpressDesign into Hemp. Select your .JPG. You will be greeted by a menu where you can set up your trace of the design. At this point you can upload to the Embroidery machine.</p>
    <img src="IMG-6421.jpg" alt="final Cosmetic 1" style="width:90%">
    <p>Step One</p>
    <img src="IMG-6422.jpg"alt="third push 2" style="width:90%">
    <p>Step two</p>
    <img src="IMG-6423.jpg"alt="third push 2" style="width:90%">
    <p>Step three</p>
    <img src="IMG-6425.jpg"alt="third push 2" style="width:90%">
    <p>Step four</p>
    <img src="IMG-6426.jpg"alt="third push 2" style="width:90%">
    <p>Here is what it should look like after trace.</p>
    <img src="IMG-6427.jpg"alt="third push 2" style="width:90%">
    <p>You can save and upload to the embroidery machine from here.</p>
    <p>12. Setting up the Machine </p>
    <img src="IMG-6430.jpg"alt="third push 2" style="width:90%">
    <p>Selecting your thread, wrap your thread into the guides to have it seeded to the upper thread needle</p>
    <img src="IMG-6431.jpg"alt="third push 2" style="width:90%">
    <p>Now we can select our design on the printer and begine the print.</p>
    <img src="IMG-6429.jpg"alt="third push 2" style="width:90%">
    <p>Here we can see that our design is selected and ready to print. </p>
    <img src="IMG-6428.jpg"alt="third push 2" style="width:90%">
    <img src="IMG-6432.jpg"alt="third push 2" style="width:90%">
    <p>These pictures are during the print while everything was going well. </p>
    <p>13. Problems</p>
    <p>It is became apparent that there was a problem. Not only was the embroidery machine slowing down but the actual thread was not sticking. This indicated that the bobbin was either not seeding the sew. I stopped the sew to check the bobbin and this is what I found.</p>
    <img src="IMG-6434.jpg"alt="third push 2" style="width:90%">
    <p>I tried to re-thread the bobbin but when i did that the upper thread would not thread into the needle and when it did the thread popped. This was a continuous problem and prevented me from finishing my embroidery.</p>
    <p>14.Final Product </p>
    <p>Here is the final messy product of what I was able to achieve given the problems I encounterd</p>
