    <p>1. Getting Started</p>
    
    <p>Before getting started with the entire process of vinyl cutting we must first understand the fundementals regarding why or why not vinyl cutting can be considered a form of Digital Fabrication. </p>
    <p>We must understand first understand what a Vinyl Cutter is. A Vinyl Cutter is a machine used in order to make signs, printed designed, and other graphic mediums. These graphics may be used in many different ways. For example, in my case, I was using the Vinyl Cutter to print an adhesive graphic to be placed on a tshirt. This can also carry over to stickers, banners, and other advertisements. That being said, the Vinyl Cutter takes vector based files and patterns such as png's or jpg's, creates a trace, and is then directed by these traces to cut in a certain pattern on the supplied vinyl. In my opinion, the Vinyl Cutter is in fact a form of Digital Fabrication. This is formally based on the fact that the outcome of the print is entirely based on human input. By this I mean that both the graphic and directions must be designed and given to the machine in order for print.</p>
    <p>2. Officially Getting started</p>
    <img src="IMG_6067.jpg" alt="IMG_6067" style="width:90%">
    <p>To get started, we needed a graphic. In my case I wanted to create a front text along with a back text and graphic. I chose to use the logo from band the Gorillaz along with a quote that one of the characters mentions. I chose to choose this band as it is one of my favorite bands holding a special place in my heart. </p>
   
    <p>3. Using Adobe Illustrator</p>
    <img src="IllustratorVinyl.JPG" alt="IllustratorVinyl" style="width:90%">
    <p>With the quote and design in my illustrator I have to create an outline of my graphic. Since I took this graphic from a JPG on google images this is not a vector based entity. Since this is not a vector based entity we wont be able to trace it in "sircutsalot". To create this graphic into a vector based and now pixel based entity we must use the "create outlines" options in illustrator. This will make sure that the layer is highquality and can be traced later. </p>
    <img src="IllustratorVinyl2.JPG" alt="IllustratorVinyl2" style="width:90%">
    <p>After creating an outlined graphic and not simply a pixel based graphic we can see that the quality is significantly better and does not include pixels. This confirmed that the tool worked and was applied to this graphic and we can now move forward.</p>
    <p>4. Time to map it out! </p>
    <img src="IMG_6068.jpg" alt="first push" style="width:90%">
    <p>Within this step I wanted to make sure that the graphic would fit onto my tshirt and that I was making sure that the graphic would turn out the way I had invisioned it to. Here I used rulers to block out where I wanted to graphic on the back to fit. It was 15w by 20h. That being said I later realized while choosing what color of vinyl I wanted to use that I was constrained by the size of the Vinyl.</p>
    <img src="IMG_6069.jpg" alt="basic changes" style="width:90%">
    <p>5. Pushing to "sircutsalot"</p>
    <img src="IMG_6070.jpg" alt="basic changes" style="width:90%">
    <p>From this magical computer we can use a bootcamped version of windows giving us access to a software that controls the Vinyl Cutter. This software allows use to upload, trace, and organize our graphic onto a virtual workspace (the size of the vinyl). Here I was able to download my graphics, upload, and trace them into "sircutsalot". From here I needed to mirror my graphic in order for it to be on the correct side of the vinyl. Making sure that the graphic was placed in the bottom right hand corner of the workspace I was ready to begin cutting. However, I need to first feed the printer the vinyl and set the cutter to its origin.</p>
    <img src="IMG_6071.jpg" alt="IMG_6071" style="width:90%">
    <p>6. The first cut!</p>
    <img src="IMG_6072.jpg" alt="IMG_6072" style="width:90%">
    <p>Now that the vinyl was fed properly and I was able to size it to fit on the allotted vinyl I was able to print. This was my first cut for the front of my tshirt. As you can see we still need to peal the excess material from the actual vinyl and find where we want to place the vinyl. </p>
    <img src="IMG_6074.jpg" alt="IMG_6074" style="width:90%">
    <p>Here is the cleaned vinyl, cut to sized, and with all excess material stripped.</p>
    <img src="IMG_6073.jpg" alt="IMG_6073" style="width:90%">
    <p>Same goes for this cut. The Vinyl came out really well, however, the actual graphic needed to be changed in order to fit onto the vinyl. This meant that the dimensions were not proportional. </p>
    <img src="IMG_6076.jpg" alt="IMG_6076" style="width:90%">
    <p>Here is the cleaned vinyl, cut to sized, and with all excess material stripped.</p>
    <p>7. Pressing The Vinyl</p>
    <p>Finally it is time to place our vinyl and tshirt onto the heat press. First we need to wait for our heat press to me fully heated to around 350 to 380 degrees Fahrenheit! Once that is the case we can proceed to pressing! In the picture you can see the vinyl aligned to where I wanted it to be. Once ready, I pressed down the heat press, waited 10 seconds for the first half of the graphic and another 10 seconds for the other half. At this point it should be pressed enough to peal the plastic off of the vinyl and you now have a pressed tshirt.</p>
