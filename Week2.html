    <p>1. Getting Started</p>
    
    <p>Before getting started with the entire process of vinyl cutting we must first understand the fundementals regarding why or why not vinyl cutting can be considered a form of Digital Fabrication. </p>
    <p>We must understand first understand what a Vinyl Cutter is. A Vinyl Cutter is a machine used in order to make signs, printed designed, and other graphic mediums. These graphics may be used in many different ways. For example, in my case, I was using the Vinyl Cutter to print an adhesive graphic to be placed on a tshirt. This can also carry over to stickers, banners, and other advertisements. That being said, the Vinyl Cutter takes vector based files and patterns such as png's or jpg's, creates a trace, and is then directed by these traces to cut in a certain pattern on the supplied vinyl. In my opinion, the Vinyl Cutter is in fact a form of Digital Fabrication. This is formally based on the fact that the outcome of the print is entirely based on human input. By this I mean that both the graphic and directions must be designed and given to the machine in order for print.</p>
    <p>2. Officially Getting started</p>
    <img src="IMG_6067.jpg" alt="IMG_6067" style="width:90%">
    <p>To get started, we needed a graphic. In my case I wanted to create a front text along with a back text and graphic. I chose to use the logo from band the Gorillaz along with a quote that one of the characters mentions. I chose to choose this band as it is one of my favorite bands holding a special place in my heart. </p>
   
    <p>3. Using Adobe Illustrator</p>
    <img src="IllustratorVinyl.JPG" alt="IllustratorVinyl" style="width:90%">
    <p>With the quote and design in my illustrator I have to create an outline of my graphic. Since I took this graphic from a JPG on google images this is not a vector based entity. Since this is not a vector based entity we wont be able to trace it in "sircutsalot". To create this graphic into a vector based and now pixel based entity we must use the "create outlines" options in illustrator. This will make sure that the layer is highquality and can be traced later. </p>
    <img src="IllustratorVinyl2.JPG" alt="IllustratorVinyl2" style="width:90%">
    <p>After creating an outlined graphic and not simply a pixel based graphic we can see that the quality is significantly better and does not include pixels. This confirmed that the tool worked and was applied to this graphic and we can now move forward.</p>
    <p>4. Time to map it out! </p>
    <img src="IMG_6068.jpg" alt="first push" style="width:90%">
    <p>Within this step I wanted to make sure that the graphic would fit onto my tshirt and that I was making sure that the graphic would turn out the way I had invisioned it to. Here I used rulers to block out where I wanted to graphic on the back to fit. It was 15w by 20h. That being said I later realized while choosing what color of vinyl I wanted to use that I was constrained by the size of the Vinyl.</p>
    <img src="IMG_6069.jpg" alt="basic changes" style="width:90%">
    <p>5. Pushing to "sircutsalot"</p>
    <img src="IMG_6070.jpg" alt="basic changes" style="width:90%">
    <p>From this magical computer we can use a bootcamped version of windows giving us access to a software that controls the Vinyl Cutter. This software allows use to upload, trace, and organize our graphic onto a virtual workspace (the size of the vinyl). Here I was able to download my graphics, upload, and trace them into "sircutsalot". From here I needed to mirror my graphic in order for it to be on the correct side of the vinyl. Making sure that the graphic was placed in the bottom right hand corner of the workspace I was ready to begin cutting. However, I need to first feed the printer the vinyl and set the cutter to its origin.</p>

    <p>6. Second Push and a New Look</p>
    <img src="Images/push%202.png" alt="push 2" style="width:90%">
    <p>The second push was successful and a first look at my new website can be seen below. Even though a lot has changed, you can clearly see how I got from that first night to my final product.</p>

    <p>7. Fixing Pictures</p>
    <p>While I had come to what I thought was the end of my knowledge of HTML the night before, a quick discussion from Matt Goodwin gave me some ideas to move forward with. Among the places I had stalled the night before was an issue with images. I knew how to link images from a website, but not anywhere else. With some inspiration from Matt, I realized that I needed to make a new folder within my main folder. This new folder was labeled "images" and is easily substituted in place of any URL by typing "src="Images/file_name." The new file can be seen below.</p>
    <img src="Images/Pictures%20fixed.png" alt="first night 4" style="width:90%">
    <p>8. New Pages - Weeks 1-15</p>
    <p>My conversation with Matt was not only helpful for solving my picture problems, but it also helped me solve the last of my big hurdles. I did not yet know how to make new pages, one for each week, which would then be linked by "Weeks" dropdown menu.</p>
    <p>Having seen several other people's Brackets pages, and now having talked with Matt, I had an idea what the end product should look like, with my index.html on the left and a list of weeks pages below. But it was only after I experimented with adding an images folder that I realized the easiest way to accomplish this. I went "File -&gt; New" then after making a new page, I went "File -&gt; Save As" and saved the new page to the "BESTDaltonAdams.github.io" folder. This process was repeated 15 times, one for each of the standard weeks in a full semester (though we will not have 15 weeks' worth of material in this class).</p>

        <p> </p>
    <img src="Images/adding%20weeks%203.png" alt="adding weeks 3" style="width:90%">
    <p>9. Connecting the Pages</p>
    <p>Taking what I had learned when altering the template the first time, I was able to quickly trim down the template to leave only what I needed within each week's page. I then copied and pasted that new template to each page. It was at this point, however, that I realized that none of the pages were linked together. Linking each week in the homepage dropdown was easy, simply going through the process of linking a URL but instead linking that week's folder. This was also made easier by using the already pre-made buttons as part of the original template.</p>
    <p>The bigger problem came when linking the buttons of each week's toolbar to the homepage, since those buttons link to specific sections of the homepage, which was now a completely separate page. Solving this required a google search, which yielded the below solution. By copying this, I was able to successfully finish all of my links for all of the pages.</p>
    <img src="Images/linking%20pages.png" alt="linking pages" style="width:90%">
    <p>10. Third Push</p>
    <p>At this time, I had accomplished a lot on my own, but another day's work had come to an end. I still needed to finish some cosmetic problems on the homepage and work on my "Week 1," but that would have to wait. I pushed my most recent work and test to make sure all of my interlinkings worked and that my template alterations in Weeks 1-15 had not had any errors.</p>
    <img src="Images/third%20push%201.png" alt="third push 1" style="width:90%">
        <p> </p>
    <img src="Images/third%20push%202.png" alt="third push 2" style="width:90%">
    <p>11. Final Cosmetics</p>
    <p>At this point, my website was nearly done. The skeleton was fully finished, but it was time to finish the skin. I was able to finish some of these final touches by myself, such as replacing placeholder images with the final ones. I did have two problems that required help. The first was getting my "About Me" text to be left set. After talking with Madison, we realized it was a formatting issue with the container which was a base setting from the original template. After comparing to other left set containers within the template, I was able to resolve the issue. The second issue was adding text over the lower left of an image, which reqired Kevin's help. After attempting to write our own CSS code and failing, we instead altered some of the w3schools code from a button which was over an image. With Kevin's help, we were easily able to convert that to being text over an image instead of a button over an image. </p>
    <p>The results of these final cosmetic changes can be seen below. My homepage is now complete, though sections of it will be updated every week (if I remember). Now onto the last step for this week...</p>
    <img src="Images/final%20cosmetic%201.png" alt="final Cosmetic 1" style="width:90%">
    <img src="Images/final%20cosmetic%202.png" alt="final Cosmetic 2" style="width:90%">
    <img src="Images/final%20cosmetic%203.png" alt="final Cosmetic 3" style="width:90%">
    <img src="Images/final%20cosmetic%204.png" alt="final Cosmetic 4" style="width:90%">
    <p>12. Getting meta and and beyond</p>
    <p>It is at this part of the process that I say goodbye to week one. In this last step I am making the very page that you are reading now (please play mind being music in your internal monologue). This has been quite simple since in reality it is only a couple of headers, some paragraphs, and some images.</p>
    <p>Now we go beyond meta - After this Week 1 page is finished, a future me (oh, the infinite possibilities) will put all of this in Grammarly and make sure that no major grammatical errors remain in my final project. Then an even more distant future me will push the final product, the final product that you are reading now (wait, are we back to just meta, oh who cares, you get the point). </p>
    <p>There are no pictures, just an email sending this URL and a happy conclusion to week one.</p>
