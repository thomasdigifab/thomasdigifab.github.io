    <h3>1. First Deadline</h3>
      <h5>Idea Phase:</h5>
      <p>After much thought I came up with three different ideas utilizing three main machines: Vinyl Printer, Laser Cutter, and 3D Printer. For my first idea, I came up with the thought to create a device that would automatically place and press a sticker onto any surface. This idea came from a business that I have been working on. Currently I have been working with a friend of mine to create a thrifitng business where we would resell used clothes. During shipping we wanted to include a printed note to say thank you but we also wanted to customize and leave our label on the box. For this I wanted something that would do this fast and efficiently. This machine would help me with this. For my second idea I was thinking about something for my car that could be personalized using a 3d printer and vinyl. For this idea I was thinking about printing a read view mirror that could be customized using different designs in order to give the best view out the back of my car. However my final idea was to create some type of formatted packing paper in place of a sticker that would be custom to our brand and something that set us a part from other brands. This took a lot of thought and after meeting with Tuna we came up with the idea to make a 3D printed fabric as packing "paper" this could include a custom design by me and would also include our logo into the mix in order to make it our own. The third idea is what I will be pursueing for my final project. </p>
      <p>Potential Sketches Related to my Ideas:</p>
      <img src="IMG-6676.jpg" class="fixing error 1" style="width:90%">
    <h3>2. Researching my product</h3>
      <h5> Inspiration and Material: </h5>
      <p>There are many ways to create and design a 3D Printed Fabric. In this section I will be analyzing the feasibility of this project while also drawing form other designs to see how I should and would design my fabric in order to have the best result.</p>
      <h6>Design 1:</h6>
      <img src="hex_3d_fabric.jpg" class="fixing error 1" style="width:90%">
      <p>Within this design we see that we have a very flexible design however the way that the design is different. In this design we see that the fabric is using a hex type of pattern while using a chainmail backing allowing to have a great amount of strength while also having a semi flexible design. This could pose as a good option for my fabric, however, something that could be super flowy could help the purposes of my final product that being said, during shipping it is important that the design would be strong enough to withstand any type of impact without seperating.</p>
      <h6>Design 2:</h6>
      <img src="wk4_nasa.jpg" alt="fixing error 2" style="width:90%">
      <p>This design, designed by NASA, uses a interlocked helix pattern to increase flexibility while maintaining flex strength. This allows for high angles of flex without any snapping or extra strain. This is a highly complicated chainmail design that would be very hard to recreate however It would give me a very good basis for a designing my project.  </p>
      
    <h3>3. Designing my Fabric</h3>
      <h5>First Prototype </h5>
      <p>My first prototype was to see if the size of the fabric would hold together in a small format while staying strong despite its size. Here is how I made my design </p>
    <img src="FINAL_1.PNG" alt="first push" style="width:90%">
    <p> - Starting off with a blank plane we start our sketch.</p>
    <img src="FINAL_2.jpg" alt="first push" style="width:90%">
    <p> - Next we have to begin with the may piece that will be the top side of our fabric. Selecting the hexaginal circular shape we place a 30mm sized shape in the center. </p>
    <img src="FINAL_3.jpg" alt="first push" style="width:90%">
    <p> - Now that we have our base we can move on.</p>
    <img src="FINAL_4.jpg" alt="first push" style="width:90%">
    <p> - Using the resizing tool we need to resize it to 10mm.</p>
    <img src="FINAL_5.jpg" alt="first push" style="width:90%">
    <p> - Now that we have it resized we can extrude this hex to 8mm in thickness</p>
    <img src="FINAL_6.jpg" alt="first push" style="width:90%">
    <p> - What it should look like.</p>
    <img src="FINAL_7.jpg" alt="first push" style="width:90%">
    <p> - Create a new sketch on the top of this hex and do not select a plane but select the top of the shape. 
    <img src="FINAL_8.jpg" alt="first push" style="width:90%">
    <p> - Create a torus on this new sketch and create it to be 4.20mm with a diameter of 1.00mm. </p>
    <img src="FINAL_9.jpg" alt="first push" style="width:90%">
    <p> - Make sure that this is a new body and not cut. This is what it should look like.</p>
    <img src="FINAL_10.jpg" alt="first push" style="width:90%">
    <p> - Select move and copy tool and begin this process </p>
    <img src="FINAL_11.jpg" alt="first push" style="width:90%">
    <p> - Input the following: Y Angle -90 Degree's</p>
    <img src="FINAL_12.jpg" alt="first push" style="width:90%">

    <p> - Move back to the FRONT view and Input the following: Y Angle 30 Degrees  </p>
    <img src="FINAL_17.jpg" alt="first push" style="width:90%">
    <p> - Here is what it should look like.</p>
    <img src="FINAL_18.jpg" alt="first push" style="width:90%">
    <p> - Selecting the circular pattern and select the torus we created. </p>
    <img src="FINAL_19.JPG" alt="first push" style="width:90%">
    <p> - Choose 3 Replicas </p>
    <img src="FINAL_20.JPG" alt="first push" style="width:90%">
    <p> - Here is what it should look like </p>

    <p> - Creating a new sketch on the top of the shape.</p>
    <img src="FINAL_22.JPG" alt="first push" style="width:90%">
    <p> - Create a cirlce anywhere on the sketch that is 2.5mm in diameter </p>
    <img src="FINAL_23.JPG" alt="first push" style="width:90%">
    <p> - Using the line segment tool select the origin and roughly attach it to the bottom right side in the middle. Make sure that is has a length of 5mm</p>
    <img src="FINAL_24.JPG" alt="first push" style="width:90%">
    <p> - Selecting the line segment you just created make sure it is using the construct setting. Creating a dotted line. Then use the cosine tool </p>
    <img src="FINAL_25.JPG" alt="first push" style="width:90%">
    <p> - Select the circle and the bottom right line segment and use the tangent tool </p>
    <img src="FINAL_26.JPG" alt="first push" style="width:90%">

    <p> - Here is how it should look.</p>
    <img src="FINAL_29.JPG" alt="first push" style="width:90%">
    <p> - Using the Offset plane tool select the top of the hex. make the distance 0.5mm</p>
    <img src="FINAL_30.JPG" alt="first push" style="width:90%">
    <p> - Here is how it should look.</p>
    <img src="FINAL_31.JPG" alt="first push" style="width:90%">
    <p> - Creating a new plane select the new offset plane that you just created.</p>
    <img src="FINAL_32.JPG" alt="first push" style="width:90%">
    <p> - Go to this angle.</p>
    <img src="FINAL_33.JPG" alt="first push" style="width:90%">
    <p> - Zoom out a little bit and create another circle roughly outside and parralel with your other circle. Make sure the diameter is also 2.5mm</p>
    <img src="FINAL_34.JPG" alt="first push" style="width:90%">
    <p> - Using the parralel resize rool. Select the origins of both cirlces. </p>
    <img src="FINAL_35.JPG" alt="first push" style="width:90%">
    <p> - Input the distance of 3.25mm between both circles. </p>
    <img src="FINAL_36.JPG" alt="first push" style="width:90%">
    <p> - Here is how it should look. It should be perfectly parrellel between both circles use the measuring tool to make sure. </p>
    <img src="FINAL_37.JPG" alt="first push" style="width:90%">
    <p> - Using the circlular pattern tool select the outside circle and choose repeating 3 and click ok. </p>

    <img src="FINAL_57.JPG" alt="first push" style="width:90%">
    <p> - Here is how it should look.</p>
      <h5>Printing the first Prototype</h5>
      <p>In this section, I will be providing some context for different decisions that I made throughout this process. During this step it was beginning to get increasingly difficult to reserve and or obtain a 3D printer. However, with the help of Tuna, I was able to use the mini 3D printer that was not readily reservable on the booking sheet. Now able to utilize this I began to setup the print. Here is how it went.</p>
    <img src="Project_FINAL_0001.jpg" alt="first push" style="width:90%">
    <p> - Starting the process Tuna and I had some issues feeding the PLA and getting it fed into the printer. </p>
    <img src="Project_FINAL_0004.jpg" alt="first push" style="width:90%">
    <p> - Here is a picture of the PLA finally being fed into the machine after some maneuvering.</p>
    <img src="Project_FINAL_0005.jpg" alt="first push" style="width:90%">
    <p> - Finally after the the hassel, we finally got the file to begin printing. This print was estimated to be about an hour.</p>
    <img src="Project_FINAL_0006.jpg" alt="first push" style="width:90%">
    <p> - During the print. Here you can see the printer beginning the brim to make sure it is sturdy.</p>
    <img src="Project_FINAL_0007.jpg" alt="first push" style="width:90%">
    <p> - Progress.</p>
    <img src="Project_FINAL_0008.jpg" alt="first push" style="width:90%">
    <p> - Here is what the first prototype looked like after print with brim still attached. </p>
    <img src="Project_FINAL_0009.jpg" alt="first push" style="width:90%">
    <p> - Another picture from the front of the printed prototype.</p>
    <img src="Project_FINAL_0010.jpg" alt="first push" style="width:90%">
    <p> - After removing the brim this is what it looked like. </p>
    <img src="Project_FINAL_0011.jpg" alt="first push" style="width:90%">
    <p> - Me testing its bending stregth. It is bendable but I wish it could go further. </p>
    <img src="Project_FINAL_0026.jpg" alt="first push" style="width:90%">
    <p> - A closer look.</p>

    <h3>4. Reflection and Next steps.</h3>
      <p>For the most part, part of the reason why I chose this form of fabrication is because of my idea. Originally I thought that it was so interesting how versitile 3D printing is and the possibilities that can go along with this fabrication method. You really have so many different options and for my project it was the best and most viable fabrication method for my idea. I find it so interesting that 3D printing can be used to create flexible designes that could eventually replace fabric entirely. However, I do not think that my product is by any means a replacement for fabric but I do think it is a step in the right direction. The next steps now are to up the scale of the "frabric" to see how it would hold and if its flexibility would increase or stay the same. Along with this, I need to prototype my second component which is my logo using the vinyl cutter. </p>
      
    <h3>5. Designing and printing my logo.</h3>
      <h5>Second Prototype </h5>
      <p>In this section I will be showing how I created my logo in Illustrator and the vinyl print of my sticker that will be going onto my final product.</p>
      <img src="AI_FINAL_1.JPG" alt="first push" style="width:90%">
      <p> - Starting off, I decided to go with a cartoony style. But I needed a body. Looking at some references of cartoon dinosaurs I decided on this shape for the body. Using the pen tool, curvature tool and direct select tool in order to get the curves and shapes that I wanted.</p>
      <img src="AI_FINAL_2.JPG" alt="first push" style="width:90%">
      <p> - Now that I have the body done I chose to move on the spikes on the back. Simply using the curveature tool I was able to connect a curved line segment to the existing body and repeated the process 3 more times.</p>
      <img src="AI_FINAL_3.JPG" alt="first push" style="width:90%">
      <p> - Moving onto the hands. These were a little more difficult to make. However, after some maneuvering I was able to achieve the desired effect. For this I created a "W" using the pen tool and connected the lines using the curveature tool to the body.</p>  
      <img src="AI_FINAL_4.JPG" alt="first push" style="width:90%">
      <p> - Here we move on the the feet. Similar to the hands I started with the closer toe creating a base for added depth. Then finished the shape using the tool to close the paths. </p>
      <img src="AI_FINAL_5.JPG" alt="first push" style="width:90%">
      <p> - Here is the closed path. </p>
      <img src="AI_FINAL_6.JPG" alt="first push" style="width:90%">
      <p> - Moving forward to the eyes which were pretty straighforward. I used the eclipse tool to create a black circle as the base of the eye then repeated this process with white circles to add detail.</p>
      <img src="AI_FINAL_7.JPG" alt="first push" style="width:90%">
      <p> - Pupil one.</p>
      <img src="AI_FINAL_8.JPG" alt="first push" style="width:90%">
      <p> - Pupil two.</p>
      <img src="AI_FINAL_9.JPG" alt="first push" style="width:90%">
      <p> - Using the same process for the first feet I created the closer toe for depth and extended the lines to represent that this is the front foot. </p>
      <img src="AI_FINAL_10.JPG" alt="first push" style="width:90%">
      <p> - Closing the path to create a solid shape. </p>
      <img src="AI_FINAL_11.JPG" alt="first push" style="width:90%">
      <p> - Using the pen tool I added a mouth with teeth. However there wasnt enough detail to determine that there were teeth. </p>
      <img src="AI_FINAL_12.JPG" alt="first push" style="width:90%">
      <p> - Before tackling the teeth I needed to finish with the other arm. I simply just copied and pasted the first arm and extented the limbs in order to make it realistic and proportionate. </p>
      <img src="AI_FINAL_13.JPG" alt="first push" style="width:90%">
      <p> - Here are the teeth that I added to add detai. I created white triangles and flipped them in order to fit into the spaces I drew in the mouth.</p>
      <img src="Artboard 1-100.jpg" alt="first push" style="width:90%">
      <p> - Final.</p>
          <h5>Printing the second Prototype</h5>
      <img src="Project_FINAL_0028.jpg" alt="first push" style="width:90%">
      <p> - Unfortunately I forgot to take pictures of the process of the vinyl cut but you may look at my vinyl cutting week to see how it is done. Since this was a adhesive print I needed to use adhesive printing vinyl. After It was printed I cut to size and prepped it to be placed on my final fabric. </p>
    
      <h3>6. Reflection two and Next steps.</h3>
      <p>I believe that my next steps are now to increase the size of my fabric and make begin printin in order to have enough space for my vinyl and big enough to make it apparent that my product works and actually does move. </p>
    
    <h3>7. Designing and printing my final product.</h3>

    <p> - From one of the last steps in Fusion 360 we chose to make the quantity of both directions 3 and 5 however we need it to be way bigger. Thereofore, I went back into fusion and exported another file where our quantities were 10 and 10 which made it significantly bigger.</p>  
    <img src="Project_FINAL_0022.jpg" alt="first push" style="width:90%">
      <p> - Here I was measureing how big the actually size of the print would be and if it would fit onto the printing plate for the MINI printer. This is the length</p>
      <img src="Project_FINAL_0023.jpg" alt="first push" style="width:90%">
      <p> - Here is the width</p>
      <img src="Project_FINAL_0016.jpg alt="first push" style="width:90%">
      <p> - Here is a picture of the screen of the printer which would tell me how long the print would take and how hot the PLA is and the printing plate is. Unfortunately this picture glitched and the screen could not be seen. However, the screen did say that it was ready to print and that it would take 7 hours.</p>
      <img src="Project_FINAL_0018.jpg" alt="first push" style="width:90%">
      <p> - This picture is showing the start of the final product. The printer here is creatign a brim to ensure that it is sturdy enough to hold together and adhere to the plate and does not move throughout the print.</p>
      <img src="Project_FINAL_0019.jpg" alt="first push" style="width:90%">
      <p> - Further along in the print we see the structure is coming together and it is holding together nicely. </p>
      <img src="Project_FINAL_0021.jpg" alt="first push" style="width:90%">
      <p> - How much longer was left in the print at this point. </p>
      <img src="Project_FINAL_0029.jpg" alt="first push" style="width:90%">
      <p> - Here is the final print of the full scale product. You can see my small print to the right and the brim has been taken off of the final print.</p>
      <img src="Project_FINAL_0031.jpg" alt="first push" style="width:90%">
      <p> - Here is the back side of the print to make sure that all the hoops and structure is in order and printed well.</p>
      <img src="Project_FINAL_0033.jpg" alt="first push" style="width:90%">
      <p> - After cutting out my vinyl in the previous section I placed it onto the final print and used an exacto knife to cut out the slots where the fabric would normally bend so that the logo would bend with it. </p>
      <img src="Project_FINAL_0034.jpg" alt="first push" style="width:90%">
      <p> - Here is how it all turned out. </p>

      <h3>8. Reflection on the final.</h3>
      <h5>Final Reflection </h5>
      <p>Throughout the project I will admit that my attention to the deadlines have been absolutely awful. I really needed to do a better job at making sure that I managed my time well. However, that being said when It came down to it I am really impressed with what I was able to achieve and my proactiveness reaching out to Madison and Tuna for help. Overall, I thought that my documentation has been really good. In some areas like the vinyl section and creating the Logo I certainly could have gone into much greater detail. However, to add some context, I did have to recreate the logo as I made it previously and in the time frame I had left I found it more important to prioritize creating this page and making sure that my print was finished on time along with all the other components. In terms of the final product, I am really impressed with how it came out. In the end I think I could have certainly done certain things better like not including a brim, made the shape a square, and made it bigger. However, in the time that I did have I am thourougly impressed.</p>
