    <p>For this weeks project we have been given the task to print a ring of our choice. This will be done by using SLA printing. SLA printing is a printing process different from traditional 3D printing methods as it uses a unique material specific to this methid. SLA Printers use a Plastic Material called thermoset liquad as apposed to a thermoplastic in 3D printing. Through this process this liquid is set and UV-Cured in layers in order to form the final product. </p>

    <p>Beginning Comments</p>
    <p>Before following there are a couple comments that need to be made. It is important to note that for this project we were given multiple tutorial videos associated with the ring of our choice. That being said these videos have their own pros and cons. For example, the video related to our ring (the spinning ring) has numerous problematic cons that can easily confuse and or frustrate someone trying to replicate this process. Some cons found in this video are as simple as not having the text in english. This may be a little redundant however the person teaching the tutorial is speaking in english. Another con, the measurements and units are european units, again, this can easily make the process just a little bit harder for someone not used to using these units. Finally, the speed of which the teacher teaches as is way to fast for such a complicated process. I had found myself sometimes watching frame by frame and or listening to it at half speed just to follow him. That being said, the person teaching clearly knows what they are doing and shows us step by step what needs to be done to the exact setting and unit which I can respect and made the process less stressful. At the end of the video he specified what the final product should look like and also gave us some special tricks to help us see what it could look like using the render tool.</p> 
    <p>1. Beginning Sketch</p>
    <img src="SLA_1.JPG" alt="mistakes" style="width:90%">
    <p>Just like any assignment that involved 3D Printing we need to boot up fusion360 and create a new sketch from there we need to start following the provided tutorial according to your chosen ring. In our case we are desgining a spinning ring.</p>
    <p>2. Following the tutorial</p>
    <img src="SLA_2.JPG" alt="hello world" style="width:90%">
    <p>Following the tutorial we begin by using our first new tool, the line segment tool. This tool will help us sketch out the beginning pieces for the inside and outside pieces of our ring. Because the video is using metirc units make sure to follow the units he is using seeing as if you dont your ring will be extremely off. Proceed by follow these steps to complete this sketch.</p>
    <img src="SLA_3.JPG" alt="first error" style="width:90%">
    <p>Make sure that your sketch looks like this with the measurements as shown. Finish your sketch and move on to the next step.</p>
    <p>3. Revolve</p>
    <img src="SLA_4.JPG" alt="fixing error 1" style="width:90%">
    <p>Here we are going to be using our second tool, Revolve Tool. Your final product after finishing your sketch should look like this. Make sure that these are two selectable objects. </p>
    <img src="SLA_5.JPG" alt="mistakes" style="width:90%">
    <p>Select both objects and go to create and then revolve.</p>
    <img src="SLA_6.JPG" alt="mistakes" style="width:90%">
    <p>After selecting both of your objects make sure to input 360 degrees. From there you should be done with this step.</p> 
    <img src="SLA_8.JPG" alt="mistakes" style="width:90%">
    <p>Here is what your product should look like once you are done. </p>
    <img src="SLA_9.JPG" alt="mistakes" style="width:90%">

    <p>4. Inner Mechanics</p>
    <img src="SLA_10.JPG" alt="first push" style="width:90%">
    <p>Here is our next set of tools that we are going to be using for this process. Go to the inspect tab where the circled drop down menu is. From there select "Selective Analysis". Here is what it should look like.</p>
    <img src="SLA_11.JPG" alt="mistakes" style="width:90%">
    <p>5. Fillet Edges</p>
    <img src="SLA_12.JPG" alt="basic changes" style="width:90%">
    <p>We are going to do two sets of fillets. Since we dont have any round edges we need to make sure that we give these edges a fillet.</p>
    <img src="SLA_13.JPG" alt="mistakes" style="width:90%">
    <p>Using the fillet tool select the outer edges of the ring and make sure that they are filleted to 1mm </p>
    <p>6. Fillet inner Edges</p>
    <img src="SLA_14.JPG" alt="push 2" style="width:90%">
    <p>Using the fillet tool select the inner corner edges within the ring. This might take a little bit of maneuvering bit once you are at an angle were you are able to select all the necessary corners. </p>
    <img src="SLA_15.JPG" alt="first night 1" style="width:90%">
    <p>Once you have selected all the inner edges make sure that the fillets are made to be 0.5mm. </p>
    <img src="SLA_16.JPG" alt="mistakes" style="width:90%">
    <p>Here is what is should look like.</p>
    
    <p>7. Text</p>
    <p>Start off by unselecting your "Selective Analysis" on the left side of your screen.</p>
    <img src="SLA_18.JPG" alt="first night 4" style="width:90%">
    <p>We are now going to be using yet another. We are going to be using the tool "Tangent Plane". Make your way to the create drop down menu and select tangent line. From there select the side wall of the ring.</p>
    <img src="SLA_19.JPG" alt="mistakes" style="width:90%">
    <p>It should look something like this</p>
    <img src="SLA_20.JPG" alt="mistakes" style="width:90%">
    <p>Right click the plane and create a new sketch on that plane. </p>
    <img src="SLA_21.JPG" alt="mistakes" style="width:90%">
    <p>When you create a new sketch make sure that you follow closely to the tutorial and make sure that the measurements are the same 80.4L and 8mmH</p>
    <img src="SLA_22.JPG" alt="mistakes" style="width:90%">
    <p>You can add another new tool to the list and add some text. Select the text box tool and follow the following steps.</p>
    <img src="SLA_23.JPG" alt="mistakes" style="width:90%">
    <p>In the text box settings select your font, write your name, select the height to 4mm, character spacing to 20mm and make sure that it is properly alligned. </p>
    <img src="SLA_24.JPG" alt="mistakes" style="width:90%">
    <p>Again, we are going to be using another new tool. the Emboss tool. Select your text and the side wall of the ring.</p>
    <img src="SLA_25.JPG" alt="mistakes" style="width:90%">
    <p>It should look something like this but we need the text to be set in the ring. Go back to your settings on the right and select the second effect with a depth of -0.33mm or else it will not work.</p>
    <img src="SLA_26.JPG" alt="mistakes" style="width:90%">
    <p>It should look like this. </p>
    <img src="SLA_27.JPG" alt="mistakes" style="width:90%">
    <p>Here is the final product.</p>
    <p>8. Rendering the ring</p>
    <p>Because I wanted to be a little more creative I wanted to add some rendering style to this. Choosing the appearance tool and playing with some of the settings provided with the rendering tab here is what I came up with.</p>
    <img src="SLA_29.JPG" alt="mistakes" style="width:90%">
    <img src="Render.jpg" alt="mistakes" style="width:90%">
